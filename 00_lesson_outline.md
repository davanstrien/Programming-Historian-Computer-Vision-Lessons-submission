## 01 General intro to lessons/computer vision 
- What do we mean by computer vision?
- Why computer vision can be useful for historians 
0 What kinds of things do historians want to have a lot of? And vice versa, what is there so much of that it has been hard for historians to look at/ask questions about the whole set?
- Practical 
- Research 
- Lesson outline
- Where to get images/data? IIIF example 

## 02 Bulk stuff with images (command line) 
- How to work with image collections efficiently 
- Why not a GUI  
- Imagemagick
- Bulk reformat images 
- Bulk resize images
- A brief intro to image formats used by libraries archives 
	- TIFF
	- JP2
	- pdf :(
	- djvu 
	- others

## 03 ‘Traditional computer vision’ 
- ‘Traditional’ CV? 
- How images are stored on a computer 
- Python image libraries
- Colour analysis 
- Edge detection
- Visual style (point to possible next steps using ML to work with the output)

## 04 Deep learning based computer vision  
- What is deep-learning 
- Why - Practical tasks 
- Why -  More research-driven 
- How? Using the output of pre-trained models? Should you use yolo/google vision api?
- Why DIY if you have a humanities questions ?
- Short example of a simple classification (correct map classifications? From loc newspapers?) - https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/ 
- A more developed use case (advertising in press directories?)     
- Building a training set
- How much data
- What labels?
- How many classes?
- Classification (transfer learning) 
- Metrics for validating performance 
- Generalisability in humanities models/data
- Reproducibility? 
- Something on working with probabilities as outputs?
